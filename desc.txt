This mod is a code pack that currently contains all resources for my Contagion Redux mod, so if you want to play Contagion Redux you must install this mod alongside it. It only contains a dummy layer which is empty. If anyone wants to put this gamemode in your map, DM me on PS modding Discord.

Future work:
ability system for zombies
more gamemodes that share a common player controller
