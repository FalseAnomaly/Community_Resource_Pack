# PSCommunityResourcePack

A community modding resource pack for the game Post Scriptum

Current available items:

Contagion Redux gamemode - the gamemode featured in my Contagion Redux mod

Set up a Contagion Redux layer for your map:

Use BP_PS_GameMode_Z as gamemode

Team One: BP_TeamInfo_Ger_SS_Z

Team Two: BP_TeamInfo_Mixed_Survivors_Z

BPs needed: BP_Bomb_Spawner_Z (remember to set the camera), BP_ObjectiveSpawner_Z (10 per layer), BP_M3_Z (1 per layer, spawn in a Vehicle Spawner), BP_BP_PS_PainVolume_BarrelFire, BP_PS_PainVolume_NoBarrel (use when there is fire in Geo layer)

The Victory screen is automatically patched by the Game State, so you do not need to copy the Geo and change it

WIP:

Offensive Child gamemode, RAAS Child gamemode - being upgraded atm, do not use

Integration of Armored Game State into Offensive / RAAS, Frontline mode, Mashup mode (Invasion plus), CTF...
